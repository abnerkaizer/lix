# Lix
A simple implementation of the readability test (Lix)

\text{LIX} = \frac{A}{B} + \frac{C \cdot 100}{A}, where

{\displaystyle A}A is the number of words,

{\displaystyle B}B is the number of periods (defined by period, colon or capital first letter), and

{\displaystyle C}C is the number of long words (more than 6 letters).
